Consider the following position, which many people tacitly hold:

Freedom is a Necessary Illusion: *The truth is that we can explain all actions mechanistically. This implies that we are not really free, and that we cannot hold ourselves and others morally responsible for our actions. Nevertheless, when we are going about our daily lives, we cannot help but believe that we are free and morally responsible. Freedom is an illusion, but it is one we need in order to live our lives.*

Is Bok's position the same as this? Explain in detail why you think it is or is not the same.

Bok holds that the success of her theory depends on whether it can adequately justify our attributions of moral responsibility to ourselves and to others. Do you think her theory is successful by this standard? Explain in detail why or why not.

## Format

Word (not PDF); 12-point font; either 1.5 or 2 spacing.

## Guidelines

These are primarily exercises in exposition. You are to give an accurate and detailed description of Bok's position or argument. I also welcome your critical assessment of her positions and arguments, but for this assignment, your assessment is less important than the expository part of your answer.Â 

You may make reference to other papers we have read in this course if you find it helpful to do so.

Since Bok writes fairly clearly, you may have to make an effort to avoid unintentionally plagiarizing her words. Use both direct quote and paraphrase. Here is a helpful guide: {{% resource_link "df2d4f21-5722-43a0-b6b4-a741bb553406" "Academic Integrity at MIT: A Handbook for Students" %}}.

This assignment is due during Session 13.
