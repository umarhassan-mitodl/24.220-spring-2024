Below are 3 separate questions about Hilary Bok's first chapter, "The Problem." Please write a short answer to each question, so that the total for all 3 amounts to approximately 1800 words. You may distribute the word count as you see fit.

1. Bok writes, "Mechanism pulls apart the naive view of freedom of the will, forcing us to decide which of is aspects—freedom from external determination or the freedom to decide what we really want to do and to act on that decision—we think lies at its heart" (21). This is Bok's diagnosis of the source of the philosophical problem of free will. Explain this diagnosis as clearly as you can. How does this way of thinking of the problem differ from Sapolsky's?
2. Bok maintains that when we hold ourselves and others morally responsible, we engage in a type of evaluation that is different from the "mere grading" of objects (35). Explain what she means by "mere grading," and explain why she thinks that moral evaluation of persons is different. Do you agree?
3. Bok writes, "I will argue that libertarians cannot identify the selves that they describe as freely choosing our actions with the selves of whose activities we are aware, and therefore that, by libertarians' own standards, the idea that our choices are determined by such selves offers no advantages over mechanism" (46). Describe the libertarian view that is the target of this argument. Then explain this argument as clearly as you can. Is it persuasive?

## Format

Word (not PDF); 12-point font; either 1.5 or 2 spacing.

## Guidelines

These are primarily exercises in exposition. You are to give an accurate and detailed description of Bok's position or argument. I also welcome your critical assessment of her positions and arguments, but for this assignment, your assessment is less important than the expository part of your answer.

You may make reference to other papers we have read in this course if you find it helpful to do so.

Since Bok writes fairly clearly, you may have to make an effort to avoid unintentionally plagiarizing her words. Use both direct quote and paraphrase. Here is a helpful guide: {{% resource_link "4a9277ae-3e18-4b0b-97aa-7cf5c4c26629" "Academic Integrity at MIT: A Handbook for Students" %}}.

This assignment is due during Session 7.
